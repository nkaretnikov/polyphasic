Cognition
---------

In order to understand how polyphasic sleep affects cognition, I'll
start taking a few tests on [Cambridge Brain
Sciences](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/browse/) for two weeks
before switching to a polyphasic schedule.  While polyphasic, I'm
planning to continue that for at least four weeks, if I don't give up
earlier.  Based on various anecdotes, the initial adaptation period
should take 1 or 2 weeks (to get back to your normal energy levels),
and it may take up to 2 months to adapt fully (to be able to move naps
a bit without destroying your schedule completely).

There are four different types of tests that don't require an account:

1. Planning: [Spatial Slider](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/browse/planning/test/spatial-slider)

   [Description](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/assets/flex/tests/spatial-slider/instructions.txt):

   "This task measures your brain's spatial planning ability. Numbered
   tiles will appear on the screen arranged in numerical order on a
   grid.  The tiles will then be shuffled so that some are no longer
   in the correct positions.  Rearrange the tiles into the correct
   order in as few moves as possible by sliding them in and out of the
   blank spaces.  Solve as many problems as possible in 3 minutes to
   gain maximum points."

2. Concentration: Rotations
3. Reasoning: Grammatical Reasoning
4. Memory: Monkey Ladder
